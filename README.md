My goal was to analyze the flexibility of course prerequisites across different colleges/areas within the university. I cleaned and transformed the dataset for analysis, then determined the percentage of courses with no or flexible prerequisites for each college/area. The final outcome was a data frame showing the 5 most and 5 least flexible colleges/areas in terms of prerequisites.
